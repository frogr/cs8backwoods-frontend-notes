# CS8 Backwoods Notes

In this file I'll be talking about some of the scaffolding decisions behind the frontend of the CS8 file structure and route layout. If you're not sure where you should be contributing, this is a good reference sheet to help you get acquainted with the structure of the frontend of this application.

## File structure

To begin with, this is the basic file structure of the frontend. I'll then go through each folder and talk about what content belongs in them, as well as any unique files that require explanation.

```

└── components
    ├── Account
    ├── Billing
    ├── Debug
    ├── Landing
    ├── Nav
    ├── Trip
    └── TripList
```
